# Fundementals of HTML & CSS
Introductory resources for Level 4 (first year) students learning HTML and CSS

Learning the basics of HTML and CSS isn't hard. Like learning any new language practice is essential.

You don't need to memorize lots of code.

CSS in particular does get much more complex (and harder), but that comes later and is beyond these workbooks which focus on the essentials.

HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript are the trio of languages that form the basis of modern web development.

- HTML is used to *mark up* your content, adding meaning and structure. For example creating paragraphs and headings.

- CSS is used to add style to the page. This might be the font used for a heading, the heading size, its positioning and its colour.

- And finally Javascript is used to add interaction to the page. These workbooks do not include JavaScript.

Web development has become increasingly complex which has led to the use of a variety of frameworks such as Bootstap and component libraries like React. We are not using these systems - we want you to learn to code.
